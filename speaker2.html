                    indistinguishable from magic</h5>
                <p>In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that, there are many things that we
                    take for granted today that weren’t even imagined in times past, that
                    weren’t even in the realm of magic. So it actually goes beyond that. So I
                    thought, well if I can do some of those things – basically if I can advance
                    technology, then that is like magic and that would be really cool.</p>

                <h5>Standing For Voice and Free Expression</h5>
                <p>Back then, I was building an early version of Facebook for my community,
                     and I got to see my beliefs play out at smaller scale. When students got to express
                      who they were and what mattered to them, they organized more social events, started more businesses,
                       and even challenged some established ways of doing things on campus. It taught me that while the world’s 
                       attention focuses on major events and institutions, the bigger story is that most progress in our lives 
                       comes from regular people having more of a voice.</p>

                <p>Design ethics concerns moral behavior and responsible choices in the practice of design.
                   It guides how designers work with clients, colleagues, and the end users of products, how
                    they conduct the design process, how they determine the features of products, and how they
                     assess the ethical significance or moral worth of the products that result from the
                      activity of designing.</p>

                  <h5>Why JavaScript is Eating HTML</h5>
      
                    <p>Web development is always changing. One trend in particular
                       has become very popular lately, and it fundamentally goes against
                        the conventional wisdom about how a web page should be made.
                         It is exciting for some but frustrating for others, and the reasons
                          for both are difficult to explain.</p>
                  <h5>About Richard</h5>
      
                  <p>Richard invented and built the start-up Pied Piper, a program designed
                     to find music matches, while living at Erlich’s Hacker Hostel alongside his best 
                     friend Big Head and fellow geeks Dinesh and Gilfoyle. Pied Piper’s compression 
                     algorithm triggered a bidding war and ultimately garnered funding from Peter Gregory's
                      company Raviga. After winning TechCrunch Disrupt -- and $50,000 -- Richard and Pied Piper 
                      are in the spotlight more than ever, which for Richard means non-stop thrills </p>

                      <p>React cares exactly zero about styling. Think of
                         it as generating the barebones HTML. React will put elements
                          on the page, but everything after that is the job of CSS: how they 
                          appear, what they look like, how they’re positioned, and 
                          how centered or uncentered they are.</p>

                        <p>
                      “As long as you think that the cause of your problem is “out there”—as long
                       as you think that anyone or anything is responsible for your suffering—the situation 
                       is hopeless. It means that you are forever in the role of victim, that you’re suffering in paradise.”
                      Byron Katie, Loving What Is: Four Questions That Can Change Your Life.
                      “A thought is harmless unless we believe it. It’s not our thoughts, but our attachment
                       to our thoughts, that causes suffering. Attaching to a thought means believing that it’s true, 
                       without inquiring. A belief is a thought that we’ve been attaching to, often for years.”</p>

                            lists starts to grow, perhaps to seven or more items. The staggering 
                            suddenly isn't working on the new ones because this doesn't

                          <h5>Some Background on Server Rendering at Airbnb</h5>
              
                            <p>Historically, Airbnb has been a Rails app.
                               A few years back that started to change, we began
                              using Rails simply as a data layer, and all render 
                              logic started migrating into JavaScript in the form of 
                              React. In order to maintain server rendering, we created 
                              and open sourced Hypernova, a JavaScript Rendering as a Service… service..

                              <p>Airbnb Experiences are handcrafted activities designed and led by 
                                expert hosts that offer a unique taste of local scene and culture. Each 
                                experience is vetted for quality by a team of editors before it makes its way 
                                onto the platform.

                                We launched Airbnb Experiences in November 2016 with 500 Experiences 
                                in 12 cities worldwide. During 2017, we grew the business to 5,000
                                 Experiences in 60 cities. In 2018, the rapid growth continued, and we 
                                 managed to bring Experiences to more than 1,000 destinations, including
                                  unique places like Easter Island, Tasmania, and Iceland. We finished the year
                                   strong with more than 20,000 active Experiences.</p>
